We encourage and appreciate all contributions, large and small, from the Pivotal community. If you're interested in getting involved, here are some ways you can help:

## Improving components and styles

All of Pivotal UI's components and styles live in the [Pivotal UI GitHub repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui). If you have a feature request, or if you want to report a bug in one of our components, [file an issue](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/issues/new).

If you would like to submit a pull request, it's a good idea to reach out to the maintainers as early as possible to help us understand the change you'd like to make. This will make the process much easier for all involved.

If your team has built a component that you feel would be a good fit for Pivotal UI (i.e. it could be useful to several Pivotal teams), let the maintainers know so we can figure out the best way to help.

## Improving documentation

If you would like to help improve the styleguide, feel free to submit a pull request to the [styleguide GitHub repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pui-styleguide).

All of the text content is written in Markdown files located in the [`docs` directory](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pui-styleguide/tree/master/docs). Smaller changes to the text can be made directly on GitHub. Each page on this site also has a link to edit it on GitHub.

## Getting in touch

If you have questions or suggestions, or if you just want to chat about Pivotal UI, reach out to the maintainers on our Slack channel ([#pivotal-ui](https://pivotal.slack.com/messages/C055JEPQQ)).
